Hey, what's up?
Not much, just hanging out. How about you?
I'm good, just working on some stuff.
Yeah, I get that. Life's busy sometimes.
What are you up to this weekend?
Not sure yet, maybe just relax at home.
Sounds like a plan. I might do the same.
Do you want to grab lunch later?
Sure, that sounds great! What time?
How about 1 PM? I know a good spot.
Perfect, I'll see you then.
Hey, did you watch the game last night?
Yeah, it was insane! Did you see that last play?
No, I missed it. What happened?
They scored in the final seconds. It was crazy!
Wow, I'll have to catch the highlights.
What are you thinking about for dinner?
I was thinking pizza. What do you think?
Pizza sounds amazing. Let's do it.
Cool, I'll order it now. Any toppings you want?
